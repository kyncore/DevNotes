# EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

## Key Concepts

*   **Instance:** A virtual server in the AWS cloud.
*   **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):** A template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications) required to launch your instance.
*   **Instance Types:** Various combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for your instances.
*   **Security Groups:** A virtual firewall that controls the traffic for one or more instances.
*   **EBS (Elastic Block Store):** Provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances.
