# S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

## Key Concepts

*   **Buckets:** A container for objects stored in S3. Bucket names must be globally unique.
*   **Objects:** The fundamental entities stored in S3. Objects consist of data and metadata.
*   **Storage Classes:** S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases (e.g., S3 Standard, S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Glacier).
*   **Bucket Policies:** IAM policies that you can attach to S3 buckets to manage access permissions.
*   **Versioning:** A means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket.
