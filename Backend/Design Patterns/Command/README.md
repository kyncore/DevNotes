# Command Pattern

The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.

## Use Cases

- When you want to parameterize objects with operations.
- When you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.
- When you want to implement reversible operations.

## Pros

- Single Responsibility Principle. You can decouple classes that invoke operations from classes that perform these operations.
- Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new commands into the app without breaking existing client code.
- You can implement undo/redo.
- You can implement deferred execution of operations.
- You can assemble a set of simple commands into a complex one.

## Cons

- The code may become more complicated since youâ€™re introducing a whole new layer between senders and receivers.
