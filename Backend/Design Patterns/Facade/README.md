# Facade Pattern

The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

## Use Cases

- When you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
- When you want to structure a subsystem into layers.

## Pros

- You can isolate your code from the complexity of a subsystem.

## Cons

- A facade can become a god object coupled to all classes of an app.
