# OOP vs. Functional Programming in PHP

This guide provides a detailed comparison of the Object-Oriented (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP) paradigms, using PHP for all examples. While PHP is traditionally known as an OOP language, modern versions have incorporated many powerful functional features, making it a true multi-paradigm language.

## Core Concepts Comparison

| Concept | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) | Functional Programming (FP) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Unit** | **Objects.** Objects bundle data (properties) and the functions that operate on that data (methods) together. | **Functions.** Functions are first-class citizens. They are treated like any other variable and can be passed around, returned from other functions, and composed together. |
| **State** | **Encapsulated and often mutable.** An object manages its own state, and its methods can change that state over time. | **Explicit and often immutable.** State is not tied to objects. Functions avoid side effects and don't modify external state. Instead of changing data, they return new data structures. |
| **Data vs. Behavior** | **Combined.** Data and the operations on that data are tightly coupled within an object (encapsulation). | **Separated.** Data (e.g., in arrays or simple data objects) is separate from the pure functions that operate on it. |
| **Flow Control** | Relies on loops (`for`, `while`), conditionals (`if`, `else`), and method calls. | Relies on function calls, including higher-order functions (`array_map`, `array_filter`), recursion, and composition. |
| **Concurrency** | Can be difficult to manage due to shared mutable state, often requiring locks or mutexes to prevent race conditions. | Easier to manage. Because functions are pure (no side effects) and data is immutable, running code in parallel is much safer and less error-prone. |

## PHP's Position

*   **OOP is King:** PHP's ecosystem is built around OOP. Frameworks like Symfony and Laravel are heavily object-oriented, and most design patterns are expressed through classes and objects.
*   **Functional is a Powerful Tool:** Since PHP 5.3 (with anonymous functions) and especially with PHP 7.4+ (with arrow functions), functional programming has become a highly effective tool in a PHP developer's arsenal. It's excellent for data processing and collection manipulation.

## When to Choose Which?

You don't have to choose one exclusively. The best PHP code often uses a hybrid approach.

*   **Choose OOP when:**
    *   You are modeling complex, real-world entities with many attributes and behaviors (e.g., a `User`, a `Product`, an `Order`).
    *   You need to manage a long-lived, complex state (e.g., a database connection, a user session).
    *   You are building large-scale applications where dependency injection and clear contracts (interfaces) are critical for maintainability.
    *   You are working within a framework like Laravel or Symfony.

*   **Choose Functional Programming when:**
    *   You are performing data transformation, filtering, or reduction on a collection of data (e.g., processing an array of user records).
    *   You need to write simple, predictable, and easily testable code that has no hidden side effects.
    *   You are handling events or asynchronous operations where passing callback functions is a natural fit.

## Real-World Project Examples

To see these concepts in action, explore the following projects. Each project is implemented in both OOP and Functional styles to highlight the differences.

1.  **[E-commerce Shopping Cart](./E-commerce_Cart_OOP/README.md)**: A classic example of state management.
2.  **[Data Processing Pipeline](./Data_Processing_Pipeline_OOP/README.md)**: A perfect use case for functional collection processing.
